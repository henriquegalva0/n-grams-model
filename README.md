# N-Gram Model

## Mission
The objective of this repository is to build a functional minimal gram model where the user can inform the "N" and it complete sentences based on one single word.

## Structure
I'm only using python and its common frameworks without searching for specific AI frameworks for tokenization, lemmatization or pre-trained models.
The portuguese version of the book ("Metamorfose by Kafka")[ua00106a.pdf] that I'm currently using was obtained from a (public book repository)[https://www.unifucamp.edu.br/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Livros-gra%CC%81tis.pdf].
